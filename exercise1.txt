-The simpledb is populated from the text file
-loads the schema for the catalog
-Essentially loads the tables and for each table, matches metadata
to the table including the tableid, the pageid, records, IO cost, etc.
-The statistics for the histogram are set up for the processing
-Then after setting up the environment, database processes the next statement in the form of a stream

-The next statement is processed whether it is an insert, delete, or a
regular query statement and a physical/logical plan is made for the 
query. 
-The query is then executed based on the set up that is made

List of things that happen before the execute in the handleQueryStatement:
-Before the physical plan is made though, the physical and logical plan needs to be set up for 
optimization. 
-The query creates a tree for logical processing in the handleQueryStatement
-Estimations of the scanCost and Selectivity are made based on this physical tree
-The estimations are then sent to the filter selectives and using the combination
of the filter selectives, the physical plan and the table stats, the order joins
are made
-the cost is then computed and the estimation is calculated. A rearrangement of the
physical plan can be made to create a lower IO cost and this repeats until 
a smaller cost cannot be computed. Then the query is executed.
